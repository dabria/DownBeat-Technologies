      p I do my best to design functional, yet beautful websites. Whether you want the design simple or complex,  I can make them work. I sketch up designs, use programs, or even code something quickly to show how I think the content should be arranged. Once I've planned it out, I take action.

      p When I'm ready to code, I lock myself in a room free from distractions and get down to business. I write to the best of my ability every time, and I write as cleanly as possible. I am familiar with many differet frameworks, design concepts, and tools. Please view Websites for more information.

      p Once I'm done the bulk of the work, I put my attention to fine tuning details. I make sure everything works perfectly, and keem my code as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as possible. This is the final step, and once completed, remiains a wonderful, functional, and beautiful product.

    p Being new to the field, I'm eager to get experience. Therefore I'm offering great rates depending on what you need. I can build a very simple site for you with Twitter Bootstrap if you need something cheap and fast, or if you're wanting something a little more beautiful and unique, I'm able to talk with you and build a more detailed site. Please contact me for rates depending on what you want built.
    p I'm also willing to join a team as a Jr. web developer/designer. Telecomuting preferred, or locally in the Greater Victoria region.
